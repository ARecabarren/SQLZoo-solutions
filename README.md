# SQLZoo Solutions

This repository consists of my personal solutions for SQL exercises, tutorials, and quizzes provided on [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/). This is for educational purposes and anyone is free to take a look and learn from it.

## Structure

The repository is organized by exercise, with each solution clearly marked and explained where necessary.

## Contributing

While this is a personal project, feel free to fork the repository and make changes. If you're also working through these exercises and spot an error or a more efficient method in solving any of them, your input is welcomed!

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
